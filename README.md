# Audio_Tagging_Classification_DL
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can be used for automatic music tagging. Automatic music tagging involves predicting which tags (from a particular set) are associated with a song from audio files. This is a multi-label classification problem as a song can have multiple tags.
